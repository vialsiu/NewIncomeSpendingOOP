I was working from the 'master' tree in:
https://github.com/vialsiu/NewIncomeSpendingOOP/tree/master
ignore the 'main' branch

I also started from building on dermot's jfx file structure
(my machine only runs that one jfx file on intellij and denies everything else)
and moved to an empty file on sunday to transfer my files over to make it work with java
because I misinterpreted and thought we are building in jfx
